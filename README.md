# TobleroneClicker
A simple game, where you.. just click the virtual Toblerone chocolate bar. That's all (for now). I will add more functions to this game in the future. If you want to make a fork - feel free to do it. The code is open source.

### Features
- Great for fighting boredom or stress. Just launch the game and start clicking the virtual Toblerone chocolate bar. I am not responsible for mouse/touch screen damage as well.
- Available on literally every platform since this is a web game. You just need a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

### End note
I am not endorsed nor affiliated with Toblerone. I created this simple game just for fun. No copyright infringement was intended.
